                <h2>Overview and Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Whiz is an educational JavaScript application designed to engage elementary school students in learning through interactive quizzes and choose-your-own-adventure story modes. Developed as a Code.org App Lab project with real classroom testing and feedback integration, Learning Whiz demonstrates the ability to design educational software that is both engaging and effective. The project was developed independently with mentor guidance, incorporating actual student feedback from classroom testing to refine the learning experience.
